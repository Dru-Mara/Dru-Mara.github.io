<h3 align="center">Personal Website Repo</h3>

## About

This repository contains my personal website and is based on the Strata Jekyll template by HTML5 UP. The template has been extensively modified and improved to suit my specific needs. If you want a simple site with a similar style, feel free to clone the repo.

**Disclaimer:** I am not a web developer, so I am certain that many things can be improved or done differently. If you have any suggestions, I'd be happy to hear them.

## Installation

To build the website you will need ruby, bundler and jekyll. Instructions on how to install these on Linux systems are given below:

```bash
# Install ruby
sudo apt install ruby-dev

# Install bundler, jekyll and required dependencies
sudo gem install bundler jekyll

# Go to the website root directory and install all gems
cd website
sudo bundle install

# Build website
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You can check if your local build of the website is working by going to *http://localhost:4000/*.
