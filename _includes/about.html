<p> Hi! I'm Alex Mara an AI researcher and entrepreneur based in Ghent, Belgium. Originally from Romania, I have spent most of my adult life in various European countries including Spain, Italy, Finland, Germany and Belgium. I am deeply passionate about AI and the myriad of opportunities it can bring us, so I built my entire career around it. To offset this nerdy part of my life, I also practice many sports such as callisthenics, bouldering and mountain biking. I am also a huge fan of videogames both modern and old-school (P.S.: try searching for a non-existent subdomain on my website, like <a href="https://dru-mara.github.io/notfound" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> :P). In what follows, you can learn more about myself, my interests, publications, projects, teaching... just keep reading! </p>

<p> Currently, I am one of the Co-Founders and CEO of <a href="https://nobl.ai" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nobl.ai</a>, a tech startup focused on delivering trustworthy AI for the labour market. We provide state-of-the-art recommender systems that match candidates and jobs, mapping (normalization) of job descriptions and courses into standard (ISCO, ESCO, O*Net, ...) and proprietary taxonomies, career coaching, and much more! If you are interested in learning more, drop me a message! </p>

<p> I also hold a part-time appointment as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (<a href="https://aida.ugent.be" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AIDA</a>) group at Ghent University led by <a href="http://www.tijldebie.net" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prof. Tijl De Bie</a>. My research interests revolve around recommender systems and representation learning as well as their applications to the labour market. Over the past decade, I have built an international academic career in AI and data mining obtaining a PhD from <a href="https://www.ugent.be/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ghent University</a> in Belgium, an MSc. (with honours) from <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Aalto University</a> in Finland and a B.Eng. (first class honours) from the <a href="https://www.upm.es/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Technical University of Madrid</a> in Spain. You can check out my full academic CV <a href="files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
